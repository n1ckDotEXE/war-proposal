## Application Summary
War is a simple game where you try to beat the dealer by drawing a higher number. In this game, you will be able to play a console based version of the game War and select a range of numbers and play within them against the dealer.

## Application Logic
The code will have 2 variables where the player chooses the range between the numbers that can be played and 1 more variable for the dealer's random number. When the player chooses a number, the code will determine if the player had a higher or lower number than the dealer and display a message based on their success or failure. A number will be randomly determined within the range with the Math.random() function.

## Stretch Goals
The goal of this game is to be fully playable with a dealer where the user can have multiple inputs without having to enter inputs all at once.
